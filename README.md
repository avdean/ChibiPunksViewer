[] Integrate into the main art-engine repo as a submodule
[] Properly configure the config.js file to allow for custom paths to the build dir

# Project setup
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important!!**
- As of this writing, this repo should be installed _next_ to the Art Engine folder so the _Viewer_ project can easily the `build` folders from the Art Engine generator. 
- As of this writing, the viewer relies on the `.edition` metadata property for indexing images.


Clone or Download this project _next to_ the generator folder.
This build expects the art-engine folder to be named `Art Engine` 
[To adjust the path of the build folder, see vue.config.js AND App.vue in_this_project]

If you are building JPEG images, change the config in `config.js` in the viewer config file.

```
yarn

// or using npm
npm install
```

### Once installed, run `yarn dev`
```
yarn dev

// if using npm
// npm run dev
```
